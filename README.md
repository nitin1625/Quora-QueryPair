# Quora-QueryPair

## Overview
This tool addresses the natural language processing problem of classifying whether pairs of questions on Quora are duplicates or not. It leverages machine learning techniques to analyze the similarity between question pairs and determine if they are duplicates.

## Features
- Classifies question pairs as duplicate or non-duplicate.
- Provides insights into the similarity between questions.
- Helps maintain the quality of Quora content by identifying duplicate questions.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries (e.g., NLTK, spaCy)
- Machine Learning Algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Word Embedding Models (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe)

## Usage
1. Input pairs of questions from Quora.
2. Run the tool to classify each pair as duplicate or non-duplicate.
3. Review classification results and similarity scores for insights.

## How to Run
1. Clone repository.
2. Install dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
3. Input question pairs from Quora.
4. Execute the tool for classification.

## Future Improvements
- Explore advanced deep learning architectures for improved classification.
- Enhance feature engineering techniques to capture nuanced similarities.
- Implement techniques for handling imbalanced data and noisy text.
